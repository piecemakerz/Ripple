description: Relate is an embedded openCypher graph database, and this is its Node.js/TypeScript package. Use this skill when writing JavaScript or TypeScript that creates, queries, or embeds a local graph database with Cypher — connecting, parameters, transactions, result handling (rows, counters, summaries, graph extraction), and read-only access.
---

# Relate (Node.js / TypeScript)

Relate embeds a full openCypher engine in-process (Rust core over the
typed C ABI v2; no server, no subprocess). `npm install
@relate/relate` — `require("@relate/relate")` /
`import { Database } from "@relate/relate"`. `query` is
synchronous (the engine runs in-process); `queryAsync` is the
Promise-returning form. Databases are a local directory, `":memory:"`, or
a `.rl` file. One writer process per database.

## Connect and query

```js
const { Database } = require("@relate/relate");

const db = Database.open("./mydata");        // or ":memory:" / "./task.rl"
const conn = db.connect();                   // optional namespace: "system"...
const result = conn.query("CREATE (p:Person {name: $name})", { name: "Alice" });
const read = conn.query("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name AS name");
for (const row of read.rows) console.log(row.name);
```

Parameters are `$name`, passed as a plain object lowered into the typed
params builder. Values: `null`, booleans, strings, numbers
(integer-valued binds INTEGER, otherwise FLOAT — `NaN`/`±Infinity` bind),
full-range `bigint`s, arrays, plain objects, and the typed classes
results decode to (`CypherDate`, `CypherTime`, `CypherLocalTime`,
`CypherDateTime`, `CypherLocalDateTime`, `CypherDuration`, `CypherPoint`,
`CypherVector`) — a decoded value binds back unchanged. `float(1)` binds
a FLOAT-typed 1.0. Transactions: `conn.begin()` / `conn.commit()` (it
returns the transaction's bookmark, `string | null`) /
`conn.rollback()`. Read-only access: `Database.open(path, { readOnly:
true })` — the store must exist; any number of readers, no writes or
checkpoints.

`conn.query` also doubles as a template tag — interpolated values become
auto-named `$p0, $p1, …` parameters (injection-safe by construction;
never concatenate values into statement text):

```js
const name = "Alice";
conn.query`MATCH (p:Person {name: ${name}}) RETURN p`;
```

Equal primitives dedup to one parameter (objects by identity); nested
arrays/plain objects are values; unsupported values (`undefined`,
functions, symbols, cyclic structures, non-plain objects — a JS `Date` is
ambiguous, construct a `CypherDateTime`) throw `TypeError` at any depth;
a shared (acyclic) reference binds at each place it appears.
No fragment composition — values are always data.

## Results

Rows are objects keyed by column name; `result.columns` is the RETURN
order. Every cell is the typed value walker's JS shape (ADR-0502 §1) —
there is no per-column type array; discriminate per value: `null`,
booleans, strings (interior NULs preserved), numbers (NaN/±Infinity as
themselves), int64 as `number` inside ±2^53-1 and `bigint` beyond
(`RETURN 9007199254740993` is exactly `9007199254740993n`), nodes
`{kind: "node", elementId, id, labels, properties}`, relationships
`{kind: "relationship", elementId, id, type, startElementId,
endElementId, startId, endId, properties}`, paths as alternating arrays,
`CypherPoint`, `CypherDate`,
`CypherTime`, `CypherLocalTime`, `CypherDateTime`, `CypherLocalDateTime`,
`CypherDuration` (four lossless components — `PT36H` ≠ `P1DT12H`),
`CypherVector`. `result.stats` carries the 11 mutation counters
(snake_case, zeros included). `result.queryType` is `"r"` / `"w"` /
`"rw"` / `"s"` and `result.namespace` the resolved namespace
(`"neo4j"`, `"system"`, `"system_ontologies"`). `result.bookmark` is the
auto-commit bookmark (`"relate:<n>"`) or null.
`result.notifications` is the engine-native query
notification list (ADR-0363) — always an array: `[]` on a plain run, the
plan-time list on `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` (`PROFILE` adds the
`EstimationMiss` kind). Each entry carries
`code`, `gql_status`, `severity`, `category`, `title`, `description`
(the diagnosis) and `remedy` (the action), plus `operator_id` on
operator-scoped kinds.

```js
const one = conn.query("MATCH (p:Person {name: $n}) RETURN p.name AS name", { n: "Alice" }).single();
const summary = conn.query("MATCH (p:Legacy) DELETE p").consume();
console.log(summary.counters.nodes_deleted, summary.queryType, summary.elapsedMs);
```

`single()` throws `ResultNotSingleError` on zero or more than one row.
`consume()` returns a `ResultSummary` — counters, resolved namespace,
query type, `elapsedMs` (engine-reported statement elapsed, ADR-0221:
parse, plan and run), its phase split `parseMs` / `planMs` / `executeMs`
(ADR-0491 — three disjoint windows whose sum never exceeds the total),
the `bookmark`, and the same `notifications` list.

## Errors

Every failure throws `RelateError` with the engine's own
classification: `code` (the Neo4j status code), `gqlStatus`, `stage`
(`"compile"` / `"runtime"` / `"internal"`), and `retryable` (also
`isRetriable`) — the retry decision. Retry only `retryable === true` (the
write-write conflict, the retryable workspace cap); never blind-retry.
`stage === "internal"` (a poisoned handle, a caught panic): close and
reopen instead of retrying.

```js
try {
  await conn.queryAsync("RETURN 1/0");
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.code, e.retryable); // Neo.ClientError.Statement.ArithmeticError, false
}
```

`conn.queryAsync(cypher, params?)` (and the tag form) runs the call on
koffi's worker thread; the error rides the result handle back, so the
rejected promise is fully classified. Overlapping calls on one
connection are serialized; any sync call (`query`, `begin`, `commit`,
`rollback`, `setNamespace`) while an async query is in flight on the
same connection refuses.

## Graph extraction

`result.graph()` returns the unique graph entities the rows carry (nodes,
relationships, paths — nested values walked), de-duplicated by element
id, in first-seen order, as a `ResultGraph`:

```js
const g = conn.query("MATCH (a:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(b:Person) RETURN a, r, b").graph();
g.nodes            // [{kind: "node", elementId, id, labels, properties}, ...]
g.relationships   // [{kind: "relationship", elementId, id, type, startElementId, endElementId, startId, endId, properties}, ...]
g.size             // entity count
```

Dependency-free conversion to Cytoscape.js or Sigma follows directly from
those shapes (`kind`, element ids, labels, type, endpoints, properties).

## Gotchas

- A result map key containing an interior NUL is refused with an error (the C ABI looks keys up NUL-terminated); string values keep their NULs.
- `":memory:"` vanishes when the process exits — use a path for durable work.
- One writer per database; open `{ readOnly: true }` for concurrent readers.
- Node and relationship values arrive as plain objects keyed by
  `elementId` (the engine's `elementId()` spelling, so
  `WHERE elementId(n) = $id` round-trips), `labels`/`properties` and
  `type`/`startElementId`/`endElementId`; every entity also carries the
  deprecated numeric ids (ADR-0506) — `id` is exactly Cypher `id()`, a
  relationship's `startId`/`endId` are `id(startNode(r))`/`id(endNode(r))`,
  all `number`-or-`bigint` by value — prefer `elementId` for identity;
  temporal values are component
  classes (`CypherDate` &c.), not ISO strings — render to text yourself.
- Int64 beyond ±2^53-1 is a `bigint` — pass big integers as `bigint`
  parameters, never through `Number` (LABS-901).
- Full TypeScript types ship in the package (`index.d.ts`).
